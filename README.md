# PhoneBook

**DESCRIPTION :** 
In this project, I have made a Simple PhoneBook Management System in which the user can *Add, View, Search, Delete* a contact, he can also *Create a file* as per the user guides the program. 

User can also end the program in between if they want to. 
I have used some concepts of OOP's with C++ to make it run fast.

User can store maximum 10 contacts.
If the user wants to increase the size of the contact list they can easily do it by changing 

```cpp
#define MAXSIZE 10
```
to 
``` cpp
#define MAXSIZE n
// where n = number of maximum contacts list you want to make
```

## Key Features :

- Stores your data in a .txt file.
- Checks whether there is an existing file for not.
- Keeps a track of your saved contacts. 
- Data is stored even after the program is ended.
