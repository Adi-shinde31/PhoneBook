# PhoneBook

**DESCRIPTION -** 

In this project, I have made a simple PhoneBook Management System in which the user can ***Add, View, Search, Delete*** a contact, 
they can also ***Create a file*** of all the contacts they have saved in their PhoneBook. 

I have used some concepts of OOP's with C++ to make it run fast.

User can also end the program in between if they want to so. 
The program will save the contact until the user ends the program, 
if the user ends the program the data saved inthe PhoneBook will get destroyed!!
To avoid this it is recommended to the user to create a **Text File** (.txt)

User can store maximum 10 contacts.
If the user wants to increase the size of the contact list they can easily do it by changing 

```cpp
#define MAXSIZE 10
```
to 
``` cpp
#define MAXSIZE n
// where n = number of maximum contacts list you want to make
```

## üìù Key Features :

- Stores your data in a .txt file.
- Checks whether there is an existing file for not.
- Keeps a track of your saved contacts. **(Until user ends the program!!)**
- Data is stored even after the program is ended.
