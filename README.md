# PhoneBook
---
In this project, I have made a Simple PhoneBook Management System in which the user can **Add, View, Search, Create a file, Delete** as per the user guides the program. 

User can also end the program in between if they want to. 
I have used some concepts of OOP with C++ to make it run fast.
