# PhoneBook
---
In this project, I have made a Simple PhoneBook Management System in which the user can **Add, View, Search, Create a file, Delete** as per the user guides the program. 

User can also end the program in between if they want to. 
I have used some concepts of OOP with C++ to make it run fast.

User can store maximum 10 contacts.
If the user wants to increase the size of the contact list they can easily do it by changing 
```cpp
#define MAXSIZE 10
```
to 
```
#define MAXSIZE n
// where n = number of maximum contacts list you want to make
```
## PROJECT IS NOT YET COMPLETED!!
## MANY MORE CHANGES WILL BE APPLIED SOON :)
